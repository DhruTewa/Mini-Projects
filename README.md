# Mini-Projects

This repository contains the mini projects created while learning the concepts of Statistics, Machine Learning Algorithm and Machile Learning libraries. .
It also contains the Data Science projects which I have done for self learning purpose.

- ### Statistical Test :

- ### Machine Learning Libraries :

  - [Pandas]
  - [Numpy]
  - [Matplotlib]
  - [Sci-kit Learn]
  
- ### Machine Learning Algorithms :
   #### Classification
   - [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/DhruTewa/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)
   - [K-Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/DhruTewa/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/K-Nearest%20Neighbor.ipynb)
   - [Support Vector Machine(SVM)](https://github.com/DhruTewa/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/SVM.ipynb)
